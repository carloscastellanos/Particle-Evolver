

in this zip file there is a temp.jar which is the TEMP server. start it 
with either temp.bat or if you are on mac/linux start it from a 
terminal using the temp.sh file.

so the server will start and tell you something about which ports are 
open for what. basically you will talk to the server over udp/osc on 
port 12000 and over tcp/xml on port 13000

there are some examples attached for director, flash, processing, max, 
and pd.
if you have specific questions how they work, let me know. just in 
short how it works:

each client udp/osc or tcp/xml has to connect to the server via 
initialization message where it also tells the server which messages it 
will respond to / basically which messages it wants to register so that 
those messages are forwarded to it by the server.

each udp/osc client needs one message that it has to send to the server 
when it receives a message with the address pattern /temp/ping
this message then looks like this /temp/pingreturn/51000 where 51000 is 
the port the client is listening at for incoming messages. this is just 
a message for the server to make sure a udp/osc client is still alive 
and online. mkae sure this ping message looks like this:
/temp/pingreturn/51000 (where 51000 is the port number the application 
is listening for incoming messages) if you if you dont attach the port 
number at the end of this message, the server will stop. _> bug

to send a message to the  system that should for example reach a 
destination with the address pattern /test would be send as /all/test 
so that the server knows that it should distribute the message /test to 
all connected clients that understand/have registered /test . the 
prefix /all will be cut off from the server and the message will be 
distributed as /test


too late now, probably you will have questions, but perhaps you can 
figure out some of the examples how they work or how the basic concept 
of this system works.
